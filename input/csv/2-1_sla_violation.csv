1;1;;;0;At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;1;A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;send the problem parameter;;;;;;;
1;1;;;2;At the customer service an employee enters (based on the received data) a problem report into system T..;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;enter a problem report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;3;Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;compare the problem report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;4;Based on this, the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;determine the necessary counter measures;;;;;;;
1;1;;;5;An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;determine the significance of the customer;;;;;;;
1;1;;;6;In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra problem fix process (this process will not be detailed here).;1;TRUE;ABSENCE;the customer is premium;;;;;;;
1;1;;;7;In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures otherwise the process continues.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;8;Taking together the information (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is created.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;create a detailed problem report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;9;The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;send the detailed problem report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;10;Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;11;After receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning.;3;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;investigate;the problem is analyzable at the level of their department;NONCOOCCURRENCE;the problem is analyzable at the level of their department;the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning;PRECEDENCE;investigate;the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning
1;1;;;12;In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning.;1;TRUE;ABSENCE;send detailed problem report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;13;If Service Management is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;perform analysis;create;;;;;;
1;1;;;14;After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems.;2;FALSE;RESPONSE;receive problem report;there are any possible problems;PRECEDENCE;there are any possible problems;check problem report;;;
1;1;;;15;If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service execution is created.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;no problems are detected;create trouble report;;;;;;
1;1;;;16;If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created.;3;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;a problem is detected;analyze problem;PRECEDENCE;a problem is detected;create trouble report;PRECEDENCE;analyze problem;create trouble report
1;1;;;17;Either trouble report or the normal execution notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;18;Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;prepare final status report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;19;Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;determine what counter measures should be taken;;;;;;;
1;1;;;20;Three alternative process paths may be taken.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;21;For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;no problem was detected;send back actual service performance;;;;;;
1;1;;;22;For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;minor corrective actions are required;undertake corrective actions ;;;;;;
1;1;;;23;Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;create problem resolution report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;24;After sending, this process path of Service Management ends.;1;FALSE;END;end process;;;;;;;
1;1;;;25;For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required;create request for automatic resource restoration;;;;;;
1;1;;;26;This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;send message;;;;;;;
1;1;;;27;Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;28;After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;receive restoration request;track all possible errors ;;;;;;
1;1;;;29;Based on the tracked errors, all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;undertake all necessary corrective actions;;;;;;;
1;1;;;30;Then a trouble-shooting report is created.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;create report;;;;;;;
1;1;;semicolon to comma;31;This report is sent out to Service Management, then the process ends.;1;FALSE;RESPONSE;send report;end process;;;;;;
1;1;;;32;The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii).;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;receive trouble-shooting report;create problem resolution report;;;;;;
1;1;;;33;Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;34;Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;create report;report SLA violation rebate;;;;;;
1;1;;;35;The report for the customer is sent out to her.;1;FALSE;EXISTENCE;send report;;;;;;;
1;1;;;36;After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service.;0;;;;;;;;;;
1;1;;;37;After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.;1;FALSE;PRECEDENCE;receive report;end process flow;;;;;;
