A (front-end) HW expert is in charge of welcoming the customer, and of following the case of the customer end-to-end.

First, the expert performs an initial check so as to understand the nature of the problem.

In particular, two outcomes may arise: either the HW expert understands that the problem can be solved in-house, or she decides that the repair must be handled externally.

In the first case, the actual fixing is done by a second HW expert working in the back-end, who is not only responsible of the actual repair, but is also in charge of writing a short summary explaining the problem and the repair. The summary is then printed by a secretary.

In the second case, two different tasks have to be performed, independently from each other. The first task is again under the responsibility of the front-end HW expert, who writes a detailed report about the nature of the problem. At the same time, a shipping clerk becomes in charge of the device expedition, which consists in the preparation of a package (and the corresponding documents).

Once the report has been written and the package prepared, the shipping clerk assembles the entire package (which will be then automatically sent to the post office).

Finally, the secretary prints a receipt (which includes also an expedition code to track where the device is currently located), and the process instance terminates.
