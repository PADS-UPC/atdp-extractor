The travel reimbursement process starts once an employee has compiled and submitted a travel request that includes the most critical information about the business trip (e.g., destination, purpose etc.).

Then, the request is selected by the system and sent to Financial accounting so as to assess it and decide whether it should be approved or not.

If approved, the system requests and then assigns to this particular request the maximum refundable amount that, depending on the company policies, may include lodging, flights, ground transportation, meals, and other incidental expenses an employee might experience while traveling for work.

After this, the request status changes to accepted and the employee can leave for her business trip.

As soon as the trip has been completed, the employee is asked to submit a reimbursement form that includes all the travel expenses.

As soon as the reimbursement form has been submitted, the request status changes to complete.

The system can then analyze the submitted form and, if the spending limits have not been exceeded, approves the refunding.

Otherwise the reimbursement is rejected. Both of these decisions affect the request status which is then used by the system to log the processed information into the company's internal storage.
