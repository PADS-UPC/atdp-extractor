Whenever the sales department receives an order, a new process instance is created.

A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike.

Then, the storehouse and the engineering department (S&E) are informed.

If the order is accepted, the order details are entered into the ERP system.

If a part is available, it is reserved.

If it is not available, it is back-ordered.

This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list.

In the meantime, the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle.

If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished, the engineering department assembles the bicycle.
