First, you have to cut the onions in slices, and then fried them in a pan until they look yellow. In the meantime, cut the potatoes in slices as well, and add a bit of salt on them. When the onions are ready, add the potatoes to the pan, and move a bit to get them merged with the onions. In parallel to this, scramble the eggs and once the potatoes are fried, put the scrambled eggs into the pan.
